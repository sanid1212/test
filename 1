Description:
The vulnerability is caused by hardcoding the file name application.config directly in a Linux script. This means that the file name is written into the script itself. If this file contains sensitive information, like passwords or keys, it becomes easier for an attacker to find and access it, which can lead to security issues.

Observation:
The script has the file name application.config directly written into it. This could allow attackers to easily find and access this important file, putting sensitive information at risk.

Impact:
If an attacker discovers the hardcoded file name, they could access and potentially steal or modify sensitive information stored in the application.config file. This could lead to:

Exposure of important settings for the application.
Unauthorized access to confidential information like passwords or API keys.
Overall weakening of the application's security, making it more vulnerable to attacks.
Remediation:
To fix this issue:

Avoid hardcoding file names in scripts. Instead, use environment variables or external configuration files that aren't directly written in the script.
Use secure methods to store sensitive information, like using a secret management tool.
Make sure only authorized users have access to the configuration files by setting proper file permissions.
Regularly check and update scripts to follow security best practices.
